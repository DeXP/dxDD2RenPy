# dxDD2RenPy
You may want to create you Visual Novel game visually, in a diagram-like way. [Dialogue Designer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1273620/Dialogue_Designer/) can help you to design dialogues visually. But it knows nothing about export to real engines. dxDD2RenPy will help you to convert Dialogue Designer's JSON files into [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/) code.
